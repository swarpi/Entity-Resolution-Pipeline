# Entity-Resolution-Pipeline
In this project, I focused on building an Entity Resolution (ER) pipeline to deduplicate records from the DBLP and ACM datasets. The task involved preparing these datasets by extracting relevant publication details, followed by the design and implementation of the ER pipeline.

Go to the root folder and run “python <subtask>”. (Replace <subtask> with subtask name)
Name of subtask files:
1.1_DataAcqusition.py
1.2_ERPipeliny.py
1.2_Clustering.py
1.3_ClusterinPara.py
1.3_ERPipelinePara.py
